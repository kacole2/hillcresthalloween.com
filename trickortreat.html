            <h1>Trick-or-Treating & Visitor Information<h1>
                <img src="img/keepcalm.png">
                <p>The street will be open for visitors during the entire month of October. Residents begin decorating yards on the first Saturday of October. Friday and Saturday nights during the month attract the most visitors and gives everyone an opportunity to casually walk up and down the street. Everyone is encouraged to please park their car and walk to enjoy all the decorations. There is plenty of street parking available on Hillcrest and Pennsylvania. Driving slowly creates traffic back ups and causes unnecessary honking.</p>
                <p>During the month, there is an estimated 75,000+ visitors. Residents normally start deconstructing yards the day after Halloween, so make sure to stop by before then.</p>
                <p>Some houses on the street will have milk crates on their walkways. Residents set these out in an effort to collect canned goods and non-perishable food items for <a href="http://www.uchmlouky.org/">United Crescent Hill Ministries</a>. Giving back is a part of every community and this is a great way for kids to see it.</p>
                <p>Trick-or-Treating will take place on Friday October 31st, 2014 from 5pm to 9pm. Rain or Shine, the zombies will still be fine. On average, 2,500 to 3,000 children from around the city will come for trick-or-treating. Multiply that by 1 or 2 parents and you can expect 5,000 people on the street Halloween night. At 10:00pm, police will sweep the streets and let everyone know that trick-or-treating is over for any stragglers.</p>
                <p><strong>Visitors</strong>, please be respectful of all the hard work that goes into this night: 
                  <ul>
                    <li>Please do not go into lawns of residents unless given permission. Many yards have lots of electrical cords and other props that could cause damage.</li>
                    <li>Vandalism or theft of any kind will not be tolerated. Police officers patrol the area more frequently during the month of October. On the night of Halloween, police officers will be staffed. </li>
                    <li>This is a holiday for the children, remember that...</li>
                    <li>Please refrain from carrying alcohol on the sidewalk.</li>
                    <li>Please watch your language since there are kids around at all times.</li>
                    <li>Be kind to one another.</li> 
                    <li>Be safe.</li>
                  </ul>
                </p>
                <p>
                <p><em>ATTN Hillcrest Residents:</em> you are encouraged donate $40 to assist in providing off-duty police officers to staff the street on Halloween night. This is a small amount to pay for the safety they provide. Please give your money to Diane Gautier at 3XX Hillcrest Ave prior to Halloween night.</p>
                <p>If you are collecting canned goods for <a href="http://www.uchmlouky.org/">United Crescent Hill Ministries</a>, place a milk crate near your sidewalk and deliver the canned goods to ___ at ___ after Halloween ends.</p>
