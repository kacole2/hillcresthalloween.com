*spolier alert... it's a website.*

This site was built from scratch using custom CSS for everything. There are bits and pieces of javascript/jquery/php that are part of plugins that were not written by myself but are used in certain portions of the site.

##Things to do:
- Create a custom way to pull Twitter & Instagram APIs and use lazy load to display them
