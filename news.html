                ...We set out on a quest to find the best neighborhoods for Halloween, the places that go above and beyond in their celebrations. Some were renowned for being trick-or-treating hotspots, with streets lined with DIY decorations and crowded with thousands of pint-sized witches and superheroes. Others took a more adult-oriented approach, with masquerade balls remixed as rowdy street parties. And in some cases, it was all about the pumpkins, the bigger and more numerous the better.<br><br>
                The common thread among all of the celebrations? It turns out -- unsurprisingly, perhaps -- that a neighborhood's Halloween celebration typically fits its everyday character. The hip urban districts have the biggest parties, the Bohemian enclaves have the puppet-filled parades...<br><br>
                Imagine a homemade, low-budget but high-creativity theme park, and you’ve got a sense of Halloween on Hillcrest Avenue in Louisville. Along a three-block stretch of the street, some 50 houses compete to outdo each other with outlandish, elaborate decorations. Many have a theme within their yard -- last year’s efforts included Area 51, a ghoulish wedding and a torture chamber...<a href="http://news.travel.aol.com/2013/10/17/best-halloween-neighborhoods-united-states/#!slide=1271688" target="_blank">(read article)</a>

                <p>LOUISVILLE, Ky (The Courier-Journal) - Halloween has become a year-round obsession for Mike Ghrist, an early promoter of Halloweenmania on Hillcrest Avenue in Crescent Hill.<br><br>

                The street has long had a reputation locally as the place to be and see on Halloween night, and Ghrist’s fiendishly involved decorating efforts over the past 18 years — along with those of others on the street off Frankfort Avenue — have won it national acclaim in new AOL Travel rankings as one of the “Best Halloween Neighborhoods in America.”<br><br>

                Ghrist, who outwardly seems like a reasonable person, begins putting out his elaborate graveyard displays during the third week in September. “I like to be open by the first of October,” he said. This year, he’s added a nauseated Roman charioteer (“Ben Hurl”), who has crashed into his driveway wall — a scene that’s intended, at least, to impart a message against drunken driving.<br><br>

                Ghrist begins hatching his plans for next year’s Halloween attractions on Halloween night, so the planning never stops...<a href="http://www.courier-journal.com/story/news/local/highlands-crescenthill/2013/10/30/hillcrest-avenue-gets-national-attention-for-devilish-decorations/3188295/" target="_blank">(read article)</a>

                <p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WHAS11)--  The Hillcrest neighborhood looks forward to Halloween each year, prepping their lawns and getting candy, while not letting the weather change things.<br><br>

                However, this stormy weather may leave some people with extra candy. <br><br>

                People, like Steve Clare and his son, came out before the storms to see the decorated street, but do not plan on going out for Trick-or-Treating on Halloween night. <br><br>

                One thing really concerning the people in Hillcrest is the decorations, some of which have been passed down through generations. With the weather predicted to be bad, some are worried they might get destroyed. <br><br>

                While people from Hillcrest said it rescheduling wasn’t practical, they said they will hang in there as long as they can on Halloween night. <br><br>

                For those heading out tonight, you will find candy on this block. <a href="http://www.whas11.com/news/local/Weather-not-affecting-Halloween-in-Hillcrest-neighborhood-230087401.html" target="_blank">(read article)</a>

                <p>LOUISVILLE, Ky. (WDRB)---There's a steady stream of cars traveling along Hillcrest Avenue, and people everywhere you turn.<br><br>

                The decorations are one of the main reasons why people like Beth Biermann and her two grandchildren, Evan and Emily, stop by every year.<br><br>

                "I just think it's a fun thing to do. We do it early. We don't do it on Halloween night because they're little," says Beth Biermann.<br><br>

                However, some neighbors say people may notice fewer Halloween decorations and some changes this year along the busy street.<br><br>

                "Just not as many. I hate that. I do hate that. There's just not as much participation," says Beth Biermann.<br><br>

                Neighbor Jase Robertson says many people have noticed some people are scaling back this year with less decorations, or none at all.<br><br>

                "On Halloween night it's just gotten so crazy, it's an effort to try to tone it back," says Jase Robertson.<br><br>

                "It was like a line at Disney World to get on a ride. It was just like, take a step...wait.

                <p>AspireLouisville- By Megan Brown -- It's the most wonderful time of the year!!!!  Halloween is such a fun holiday and no matter what age you are, you can't deny that getting dressed up and receiving candy is a good day indeed!<br><br>

                When I moved to Louisville and found out about Halloween Street, well... it set my heart aflutter. What was that?  You've never heard of Halloween Street?!  Oh my, you have been missing out!!  Located in Crescent Hill, Hillcrest Avenue has become the "winter wonderland" for Halloween.  Lauren Reherman, friend and Hillcrest Avenue homeowner, was kind enough to give me a little insight to what it actually takes to pull the decorating task off.<br><br>

                <p>LOUISVILLE, KY (WWDRB) - Hillcrest Avenue residents in Louisville's Crescent Hill neighborhood prepare for thousands of trick-or-treaters on Halloween.<br><br>

                Decorations get bigger and better every year, with neighbors coming together to put on the city's premier Halloween event.<br><br>

                The event always happens on October 31st no matter what day of the week.<br><br>

                Homeowners suggest for smaller kids to start going door to door around 5 p.m. Things wrap up close to 10 p.m.<br><br>

                This year during the Halloween season, the neighbors on Hillcrest Avenue will be collecting canned goods for the United Crescent Hill Ministries.<br><br>

                If you plan to stop by to look at Halloween decorations, please consider bringing a canned good.<br><br>

                Look for milk crates or boxes at several homes to deposit items....  <a href="http://www.wdrb.com/story/15911960/hillcrest-avenue-is-ready-for-another-halloween" target="_blank">(read article)</a></p>

                <p>Leo Weekly By Sara Havens - In 2009, U.S. consumers spent more than $5 billion on Halloween decorations, costumes and candy. Half of that figure was spent right here in Louisville, on one street in Crescent Hill — Hillcrest Avenue. OK, so maybe the latter factoid is a bit of an exaggeration, but if you’ve strolled down Hillcrest on any given night in October, it wouldn’t seem like much of a stretch. For more than two decades, the neighbors on Hillcrest have made it the central spot for trick-or-treating, people watching and one-upping each other on extravagant yard displays. Let’s just say that the effort put into Hillcrest during Halloween would make Clark Griswold blush.<br><br>

                Thousands of Louisvillians — children and adults alike — flock to the avenue Halloween night. Residents David Carpenter and Andrew Held both quote me a figure of more than 6,000 pieces of candy handed out last year. “Halloween, costumes and large crowds of people tend to encourage strange behavior,” says Held, who lives at 321 Hillcrest. “Halloween night becomes an odd blend of typical trick-or-treating, Mardi Gras and the Kentucky State Fair — minus the corn dogs and funnel cakes. It’s quite the show.”... <a href="http://leoweekly.com/ae/crescent-chill" target="_blank">(read article)</a></p>
